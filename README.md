# Data-Engineer-Project
This project involves extracting data from the AdventureWorks OLTP database of a retail company and staging
it in a new database staging area. The goal is to transform and structure the data to store it
in a data warehouse. The data warehouse will facilitate generating reports on various aspects such as
product performance, sales performance, store performance, and salesperson performance for the resellers/stores of the company.

The technologies used for this project will include:

SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services): Used for extracting, transforming, and loading data from the OLTP database to the staging area.
Microsoft SQL Server: The relational database management system (RDBMS) for storing and managing staged data.
Microsoft Power BI: The business intelligence tool used for creating interactive visualizations and reports based on the data stored in the data warehouse.
So that you know, the revised version includes minor edits for clarity and readability.

1. The Staging of the data folder has all the tables and code needed.
2. The DWH folder has all the tables about the dimensions for the data warehouse need.
3. The zip folder is the SSIS package for loading the data for the staging and the fact tables in the warehouse.
